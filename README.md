This is the core implementation of [BLOC.MONEY](https://bloc.money). It is open source and completely free to use without restrictions, except for those specified in the license agreement below. There are no restrictions on anyone creating an alternative implementation of [BLOC](https://bloc.money) that uses the protocol and network in a compatible manner.

As with many development projects, the repository on Github is considered to be the "staging" area for the latest changes. Before changes are merged into that branch on the main repository, they are tested by individual developers in their own branches, submitted as a pull request, and then subsequently tested by contributors who focus on testing and code reviews. That having been said, the repository should be carefully considered before using it in a production environment, unless there is a patch in the repository for a particular show-stopping issue you are experiencing. It is generally a better idea to use a tagged release for stability.

**Anyone is welcome to contribute to BLOC's codebase!** If you have a fix or code change, feel free to submit it as a pull request directly to the "master" branch. In cases where the change is relatively small or does not affect other parts of the codebase it may be merged in immediately by any one of the collaborators. On the other hand, if the change is particularly large or complex, it is expected that it will be discussed at length either well in advance of the pull request being submitted, or even directly on the pull request.

### How To Compile

#### Ubuntu LTS and MacOS 10.10+

There is a bash installation script for Ubuntu 16.04+ and MacOS 10.10+ which can be used to checkout and build the project from source:

`$ curl -sL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/furiousteam/BLOC/master/scripts/multi_installer.sh" | bash `

On Ubuntu you will be asked for sudo rights to install software. The binaries will be in `./src` after compilation is complete.

This script can be used from inside the git repository to build the project from the checked out source, `./multi_installer.sh`

See the script for more installation details and please consider extending it for your operating system and distribution!

If the script doesn't work for you:

#### [new!] Raspberry Pi 3 B+
The following images are known to work.

##### OS Distribution

- https://github.com/Crazyhead90/pi64/releases
- https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Architectures/ARM/Raspberry_Pi#aarch64_supported_images_for_Raspberry_Pi_3
- https://archlinuxarm.org/platforms/armv8/broadcom/raspberry-pi-3

##### Building

- `git clone -b master --single-branch https://github.com/furiousteam/BLOC`
- `cd bloc`
- `mkdir build && cd $_`
- `cmake ..`
- `make`


#### Linux

##### Prerequisites

- You will need the following packages: boost (1.55 or higher), rocksdb, cmake, git, gcc (4.9 or higher), g++ (4.9 or higher), make, and python. Most of these should already be installed on your system.
- For example on Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install -y build-essential python-dev gcc g++ git cmake libboost-all-dev`

##### Building

- `git clone -b master --single-branch https://github.com/furiousteam/BLOC`
- `cd bloc`
- `mkdir build && cd $_`
- `cmake ..`
- `make`

#### Apple

##### Prerequisites

- Install [cmake](https://cmake.org/). See [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23849962/cmake-installer-for-mac-fails-to-create-usr-bin-symlinks) if you are unable call `cmake` from the terminal after installing.
- Install the [boost](http://www.boost.org/) libraries. Either compile boost manually or run `brew install boost`.
- Install XCode and Developer Tools.

##### Building

- `git clone -b master https://github.com/furiousteam/BLOC`
- `cd bloc`
- `mkdir build && cd $_`
- `cmake ..` or `cmake -DBOOST_ROOT=<path_to_boost_install> ..` when building
  from a specific boost install. If you used brew to install boost, your path is most likely `/usr/local/include/boost.`
- `make`

The binaries will be in `./src` after compilation is complete.

Run `./src/BLOCd` to connect to the network and let it sync (it may take a while).

#### Windows 10

##### Prerequisites
- Install [Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition](https://www.visualstudio.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Community&rel=15&page=inlineinstall)
- When installing Visual Studio, it is **required** that you install **Desktop development with C++** and the **VC++ v140 toolchain** when selecting features. The option to install the v140 toolchain can be found by expanding the "Desktop development with C++" node on the right. You will need this for the project to build correctly.
- Install [Boost 1.59.0](https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost-binaries/1.59.0/), ensuring you download the installer for MSVC 14.

##### Building

- From the start menu, open 'x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for vs2017'.
- `cd <your_bloc_directory>`
- `mkdir build`
- `cd build`
- Set the PATH variable for cmake: ie. `set PATH="C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Community\Common7\IDE\CommonExtensions\Microsoft\CMake\CMake\bin";%PATH%`
- `cmake -G "Visual Studio 14 Win64" .. -DBOOST_ROOT=C:/local/boost_1_59_0` (Or your boost installed dir.)
- `MSBuild BLOC.sln /p:Configuration=Release /m`
- If all went well, it will complete successfully, and you will find all your binaries in the '..\build\src\Release' directory.
- Additionally, a `.sln` file will have been created in the `build` directory. If you wish to open the project in Visual Studio with this, you can.
